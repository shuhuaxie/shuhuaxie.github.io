1. Open (or create) the rc file for your shell. 
For example, macOS Mojave (and earlier) uses the Bash shell by default,
 so edit $HOME/.bash_profile or $HOME/.bashrc.
  macOS Catalina uses the Z shell by default,
   so edit $HOME/.zshrc. 
   If you are using a different shell, 
   the file path and filename will be different on your machine.
2. Add the following line and change 
[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY] to be 
the path where you cloned Flutter’s git repo:
```
$ export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
```
3. Run source $HOME/.<rc file> to refresh the current window, 
or open a new terminal window to automatically source the file.
4. Verify that the flutter/bin directory is now in your PATH by running:
   
```
    $ echo $PATH
```
   Verify that the flutter command is available by running:
```
    which flutter
```
